# Day 11

## Times

- Silver: 18:08

- Gold: 49:32

## Experience

Surprisingly today was rather easy for a penultimate day. Or I just like dealing with dictionaries, idk xD

I solved silver fast enough so that the school leaderboard would let me think that I solved it first (except it took over 6 minutes to update apparently xD).

I had to draw the entire graph for gold to find out where I had duplicated requests form some servers. Turns out I didn't actually know how to use `np.Array.any()` / `.all()`, so I ended up summing and comparing to 0 instead. At least now I know, I guess :') Also, I couldn't detect the problem of unsent requests by debugging, but thankfully it was the only edge case and the one that I could think of!

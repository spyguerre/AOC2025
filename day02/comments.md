## Experience

Well I'm first on school leaderboard for silver today apparently; even though I missed an **entire minute** because I didn't shift-copy from the terminal and pasted the wrong thing (which is honestly annoying, because I took the time to check all the indices one-by-one and had the result first-try).

Gold was... well I just can't read apparently. I totally missed the "*made **only** of*" in the subject. So I first looked for 15 minutes for each pattern of each possible size that appeared in a given number, add it to a set and ensure it wasn't present "*at least twice*" (which made sense in my head at that point :/). Then I thought my program was wrong for some reason, realized I only had to check for 1-sized patterns, following my logic, wrote a simpler program to only check for those, got the same result and was confused. Only then did I start to print the invalid numbers and compare (which I should have done much sooner). And then obviously it was rather easy :').

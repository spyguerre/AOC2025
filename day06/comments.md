## Experience

Wasn't too technically difficult but was fun :)
Silver was pretty straightforward even though reading the subject at first was a little frightening since I am not so confident with extracting data from regex in python.
I didn't look too deep into the input for gold (so that I could do fewer assumptions), and implemented a "general" solution right off the bat (so that I wouldn't have to worry about the amount of numbers in a problem, the number of empty columns between two problems, the position of the operator, the vertical position of numbers...). Pretty happy it worked first try as well!

## Experience

Well I spent literally 5 minutes to silver's subject because it looked soooo much like an optimization problem, except it just wasn't one haha. But today was really fun!
I'm pretty happy with the data structures I used to compute the circuits. There probably still are small adjustments that would reduce the complexity, but the solution I found is pretty elegant and works well!
Also gold was a joke since I had no complexity issue, but I still took so long writing the break condition and putting it in the right place somehow xD

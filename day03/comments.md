## Experience

Found this one very basic tbh (no edge case), though for some reason some people told me they found it pretty hard. For once I was already on the right track for silver, so I was a little faster than the two previous days to get the gold. Still took me way too much time, because I struggled soooo much with stupid indices... oh well :')

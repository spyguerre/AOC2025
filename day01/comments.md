## Experience

Firstly, today was the first time I attempted an AOC challenge live in a language I'm really comfortable with.
Obviously the first challenges were easy as always, but I'm pretty happy I was able to read and solve silver that fast! However I missed SIX times on gold, so I had to wait 5 minutes several times before trying again;
on 5 of those attempts I had the correct solution on the examples though, so figuring out all the (few, in the end) edge cases took me a while.

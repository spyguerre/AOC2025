## Experience

Today was... weird? I guess the objective was more about analyzing data rather than process them or come up with a fancy algorithm. But I didn't really like the fact that it wasn't really hinted anywhere (and especially not in the test input).

Basically, all you had to do was to count the regions that weren't large enough to place all the presents. And er... that's all, no need for a packing algorithm or anything else x)
Which I obviously only realized after having built the rotation and flip algorithm, was mostly done writing the problem formally and was starting to write sparse matrixes...
If that was a trap for players who do not study the input well enough before they start to write code, that worked very well for me xD

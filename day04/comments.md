## Experience

Today was really straightforward and not that interesting tbh.
The only possible optimisations I've thought/heard of are just caching the position of each paper roll in a separate array with its current number of neighbour papers, and basically just work operations directly in the array (including updating the neighbour count when a paper is removed). But it's not necessary at all x).
Also got really lucky to get part 2 first try, my while loop's stop condition was computed absolutely disastrously (cleaned up my code a few hours later, but I couldn't even explain how why the condition was right xD).
Though the util functions and bash script that I wrote yesterday were useful already and worked flawlessly so that's a win :)
